title: Something, Anything! besides Javascript
---
Apparently Javascript is now the most popular programing language. Gulp.

Javascript came about as a tiny language [created in 10 days](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript).
Yes created in 10 days. Oops! We've suffered for 20 years because the most portable platform for software distribution was an accident! You know you have a serious problem with a mainstream language when the number of other [*alternatives*](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js) to replace it
by is approaching 500!

Thankfully we are seeing [many other languages being compiled into Javascript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js).
As a lover of Ruby - my personal favorate is [opal](http://opalrb.org/).
