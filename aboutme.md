subtitle: About me
---                 
Russell has attempted and failed to find software Nirvana more time than he cares to admit.
He founded [OptiShot](http://www3.optishotgolf.com) to scratch an itch. 
He was the Chief Architect at Concur and built frighteningly large systems. 
Along the way, he fell seven times, but got up eight.

When not obsessing over interesting problems and listening to KEXP, he sails, cooks and plays hockey, but not simultaneously.

He is co-founder at [Voomify](http://voomify.io), a software consulting company.

***He is available for hire.***

You can reach him via email *russell at voomify.com* or phone [231.590.1153](tel:12315901153)
