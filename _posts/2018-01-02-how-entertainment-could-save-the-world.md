As the CTO of [Getotix](http://geotix.com), I've been building a world-class event ticketing system with an awesome team. 
I wanted to reflect on the importance of entertainment and specifically local events.

I know it sounds clich√©, another software company trying to do something important that 'changes the world'.

The difference is that I really believe that going to see a play at your local theater can make the world a better place.

## Say What?

OK stick with me here, the conditions that make up the human experience are tough. 
When you are standing across from someone, 
remember that you don't know what they are going through or what they have been through. 
Life has a way of putting heavy rocks on our backs that we carry around and hide from others.

Entertainment lifts those rocks from our backs and relieves us from the weight of life. 

Whoa Russ, I hear you but you're equating saving the world to going to see a local play.
Yes, yes I am. Look it may not be world peace, but if you took two leaders of the world to see [A Midsummer Night's Dream](https://mynorthtickets.com/events/a-midsummer-night-s-dream-540108ec-b783-4d24-a650-e8288299da60) 
they would be hard pressed not to see eye to eye about at least one thing.

Theater can change our perspective. It can open our eyes to what's really important. It can make us laugh at what's really scary.
It can start a conversation that we would never start about something important. It connects us to what matters more than our problems.
It connects us to the others that we share that experience with.

With everyone looking at their phone all the time.

Getting out and talking to each other face to face will reconnect us to each other.

What would happen if we all took this one step forward together?

So get out and see some local theater, or music, or food, or festivals. Get up and do your part is making the world a better place, 
you never know we might just save the world together! To be sure it will be a better place for it.
