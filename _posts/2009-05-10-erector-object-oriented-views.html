I just got back from railsconf. On the plane ride home I decided to take a look at <a
      href="http://erector.rubyforge.org/userguide.html">Erector</a>. Erector, besides having a cool name, is a
      dsl for writing markup. It is very similar to markaby, except erector views are not templates, they are plain old
      ruby objects. Let's look at an example:<br /><pre class='code'><code><br />class
      Views::Home::Index &lt; Views::Layouts::Application<br /> def main_content<br /> h1 'Welcome to
      Voomify'<br /> p do<br /> text 'What is Voomify?'<br /> end<br /> p "Voomify is the verb
      for applying Voom to a problem."<br /> <br /> p "Voom as defined by Dr Seuss in 'The Cat in the Hat
      Comes Back':"<br /> <br /> blockquote do<br /> p "'Voom is so hard to get,<br /> You never
      saw anything<br /> Like it, I bet.<br /> Why, Voom cleans up anything<br /> Clean as can be!'"<br
      /> <br /> p "Then he yelled,<br /> 'Take your hat off now,<br /> Little Cat Z!<br />
      Take the Voom off your head!<br /> Make it clean up the snow!<br /> Hurry! You Little Cat!<br />
      One! Two! Three! GO!'"<br /> <br /> p "Then the Voom...<br /> It went VOOM!<br /> And, oh
      boy! What a VOOM!"<br /> <br /> <br /> p "Now, don't ask me what Voom is.<br /> I never
      will know.<br /> But, boy! Let me tell you<br /> It DOES clean up snow!"<br /> end<br />
      <br /> end<br />end<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This will render the
      following code:<br /><br /><pre class='code'><code><br />&lt;h1&gt;Welcome
      to Voomify&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is Voomify?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voomify is the
      verb for applying Voom to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voom as defined by Dr Seuss in 'The Cat in
      the Hat Comes Back':&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Voom is so hard to get,<br />
      You never saw anything<br /> Like it, I bet.<br /> Why, Voom cleans up anything<br /> Clean as
      can be!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he yelled,<br /> 'Take your hat off now,<br /> Little
      Cat Z!<br /> Take the Voom off your head!<br /> Make it clean up the snow!<br /> Hurry! You
      Little Cat!<br /> One! Two! Three! GO!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the Voom...<br /> It
      went VOOM!<br /> And, oh boy! What a VOOM!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, don't ask me what Voom is.<br
      /> I never will know.<br /> But, boy! Let me tell you<br /> It DOES clean up snow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br
      /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Admittedly this is not a very good example
      showing any benefit at all to using Erector. It is all markup and requires no real logic at all. Be patient we'll
      eventually get there.<br /><br /><br />Why would anyone want to do that? We'll for one I hate
      markup. (When I'm in full markup mode, i feel dirty.) If you love markup and erbs, then you should stop reading
      now. Before you leave, I'll leave you with this, you can easily mix erector and erbs (or any other template that
      works with rails). Some tasks are very well suited to markup and others are better suited to a markup dsl. If you
      are tag heavy then you should stick with your erb's. If you find you views are light with markup but heavy with
      ruby flow and control logic then erector or markaby may be the ticket. <br /><br /><h3>Markaby
      or Erector</h3><br /><br />I dont' know much about Markaby. After taking Erector for a spin, I
      took a closer look at Markaby. I like it. The biggest difference to me is that Markaby allows you to create ruby
      template files the same way erb's do. The views are still templates with ruby syntax. They are not first class
      ruby objects. With erector they are first class plain old ruby objects. Why is this good? It gives you all the
      tools of inheritance and mixin's for your views. That is cool. Especially for an application with multiple views
      of the same underlying models. You can refactor your views into base classes that derive and render the same data
      in different ways. This is object oriented design for views. Nice.<br /><br /><br /><h3>Side
      Note</h3><br /><br />I've seen object oriented view code in other languages and it leads to some
      very powerful re-use that all OO programmers can understand. The most ambitious of these attemps was by an HR
      company named Seeker in the bay area. I was working for Concur at the time and we bought Seeker back in 1999. (It
      did not work out well, but that is a story for another time.) Seeker created their own markup language that was
      object oriented. The nature of HR data is that it has very complicated rules regarding who can see what data and
      when. The OO design of the language allowed that to be abstracted to the base classes and a functional programmer
      simply focused on the problem at hand. They took it further, as all commercial enterprise applications do, and
      they allowed the customer to define new models and views. Those views were very easy to write with this advanced
      data access logic abstracted out. Their customers loved it. They wrote very advanced business applications on top
      of this abstraction.<br /><br /><br /><h3>A Closer Look</h3><br /><br />So
      let's look a little deeper at using Erector with rails. Follow the erector installation and you'll be able to
      write an erector view. One gotcha I ran into was the fact that your views should derive from Erector::RailsWidget.
      If you don't do that you don't have access to the rails helpers.<br /><br /><h3>To layout or not
      to layout</h3><br /><br />You have a couple of options for the layout. You can keep your erb
      layout and just drop in your Erector views. That is cool if you have an app already that you want to mix erector
      into quickly. It also allows the views to be rendered with different layouts.<br /><br /><br />The
      other option is to create an Erector layout. If you do that then you set your controler like so:<br /><br
      /><pre class='code'><code><br />class HomeController &lt; ApplicationController<br />
      layout nil<br />...<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Here is a simple erector
      layout:<br /><br /><pre class='code'><code><br />class Views::Layouts::Application
      &lt; Erector::RailsWidget<br /> def javascript_includes <br /> javascript_include_tag
      'application' <br /> end<br /><br /> def stylesheet_includes<br /> stylesheet_link_tag
      'styles' <br /> end<br /><br /> def header<br /> h1 'Voomify'<br /> end<br /><br
      /> # override this to render your view 'main' content<br /> def main_content <br /> end<br />
      <br /> def footer <br /> a 'Home', :href=&gt;"/"<br /> end<br /><br /> <br />
      def content<br /> <br /> html do<br /> head do<br /> title "Voomify"<br />
      javascript_includes<br /> stylesheet_includes<br /> end<br /> body do <br /> <br />
      div :id=&gt;"maincontainer" do <br /><br /> div :id=&gt;"contentwrapper" do<br /> div
      :id=&gt;"topsection" do<br /> header<br /> end<br /> <br /> div :id=&gt;"contentcolumn"
      do<br /> main_content<br /> end<br /> div :id=&gt;"footer" do<br /> footer <br />
      end<br /> end <br /> end<br /> end<br /> end <br /> end<br />end<br /></code></pre><br
      /><br /><br /><br />Then you derive your view from the layout erector class. The view example
      above does just that. Notice that the view defined above implements main_content. This is the method defined by
      our layout, you can name it whatever you want. You'll also notice that it has methods to override for the header,
      footer, javascript_includes and stylesheet_includes. So if the page want's to modify any of those elements all it
      needs to do is override those methods. It can call super if it wants or just replace it.<br /><br /><br
      />This got me thinking about the decoupled relationship between templates and their view. The view does not
      know anything about where they are being rendered. Generally this is a very good thing. For example a view may be
      rendered on a page, or as an ajax call. Coupling the view to the layout creates a tight dependency between the
      two. This troubled me at first. (OK not that much, the world has bigger problems!) But then I started thinking
      about it. How often do I have single view that has a different layout? Not much. When I do with Erector I could
      use a decorator pattern from my base layout. OK that works. What about ajax forms? I have not tried it yet, but
      I'm pretty sure I can call my main_content to return to an ajax request. <br /><br /><br /><br
      />OK so not very often do I have multiple layout variations with the same view. What does happen a lot is that
      I would like to make a modification to how the layout renders based on the view. Eventually the layout ends up
      with conditionals that render some of the erb if some variable is set by the controller. Yuck! How many times have
      you done that. (Be honest!) You say to yourself its ugly, but it's a template. You grit your teeth and move on. Or
      if it really bothers you, you introduce a helper, but it suffers from the same condition, branching logic, but now
      its written in ruby. An Object Oriented layout can easily eliminate that. Another case is when a view participates
      in another relationship. For example a given view may be related to other models in the system. The layout defines
      a standard layout for this relationship and then the view code implements main_content and related_content. The
      related_content method could return markup, or the layout may take care of the markup, and all the related content
      needs to do is return the model objects that are related to my current view. <br /><br /><br />In
      my next post I'll be building a simple contact model and then turning it into an Erector set of views. Until then
      ... keep it clean.
