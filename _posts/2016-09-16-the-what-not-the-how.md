title: The What not the How

I recently read the Quora question [What is Alan Kay's definition of Object Oriented?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Alan-Kays-definition-of-Object-Oriented?srid=uNkZ2&share=7946a555) answered by Alan Kay himself.

And he rightly pointed out we NEED to turn our design skills and attention focusing on the **What** and not the **How**.

Yet every day I am surrounded by the **How**. I have to wade through layers of **How** to even find the **What**.
It is beyond the point of being absurd. It is like we are being asked to hang a picture on a wall but we have to build
the wall first. Where should it go? What material should we build the wall out of? What color should we paint it? Seriously?

### Why? ###
**Is the level of abstraction we are using for the What too low?**  
Yes, for sure. 

**Do we need better abstractions?**  
Yes, for sure.

**Do we need better framework(s)?**  
No, we have plenty of frameworks that focus on different ways to achieve the **How**.
The one thing we appear to be really good at is inventing another du jour **How**.

**So what is the solution?**  
We need to stop mixing/burying the **What** with the **How**.  
The **How** needs to start servicing the **What** and not vice versa.  
We need a more common way to speak to each other about **What**.  
We need tools that understand the **What** and direct the **How**.

### OK where should I put this wall? ###
