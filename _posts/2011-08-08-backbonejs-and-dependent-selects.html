I had a fairly simple development task. Once I've done 20 different ways over the years. I have
      a select control with customers. When it changes I need to load the set of customer shipping addresses. The client
      code was a combination of jquery ajax calls and a custom client library for rendering/managing to server restful
      resources. Pretty quickly the code was getting messy! The problem seemed so easy, but the code did not reflect
      that. I decided to refactor it using <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>backbone.js</a>.
      I'm going to show you how I solved this problem in this post. It will not cover the basics of <a
      href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>backbone.js</a>. It will cover a simple use case and the
      design I came up with. It also covers some caveats I discovered with <a
      href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>backbone.js</a>. <br /><br />Finally <a
      href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>backbone.js</a> has entered my development toolkit. I
      was waiting for it without even knowing it. It addresses so many issues with typical client code development. <br
      /><br />If you don't know what Backbone is, then I suggest you visit <a
      href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>backbone.js</a>. They have a number of tutorials.
      (Including this one.) The docs are solid. Once you bone up on the basics come on back. <br /><br />One
      of the first benefits was the code organization. With Backbone and <a
      href='http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/'>Jammit</a> (for rails) I can layout a really nice
      development tree with each class in its own file. Here is the tree I currently have setup:<br /><br /><pre
      name="code" class="bash">├── app<br />│   ├── helpers<br />│   ├── models<br />│   │   └──
      collections<br />│   ├── templates<br />│   └── views<br />└── core<br /> ├── helpers<br
      /> ├── models<br /> ├── templates<br /> │   └── controls<br /> └── views<br /> └──
      controls</pre><br />I am able to have a 'core' set of helpers, models, templates, and views that are
      used across applications. This is not really a backbone feature, but because of backbone I setup <a
      href='http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/'>Jammit</a> this way.<br /><br />The second
      thing I really loved was the clear separation between model and view. This just feels so natural having done the
      same thing on the server side for so many years. I'm going to assume you are familiar with the three basic
      backbone classes that I'm going to use: Model, Collection and View.<br /><br />Ok the problem is how
      to have one select change and then once the change occurs, populate another select with a collection based on the
      first selected. In my case I have the models 'Customer' and 'Address'. A customer has many shipping addresses. So
      every time a new customer is selected a different set of shipping addresses need to be loaded. <br /><br
      />Let's start by taking a look at the models (you'll see they are trivial).<br /><br /><pre
      name="code" class="javascript">App.Models.Customer = Backbone.Model.extend({});</pre><br /><br /><pre
      name="code" class="javascript">App.Models.Address = Backbone.Model.extend({});</pre><br /><br />Ok
      those were trivial. I like trivial. Now we will look at the collections. These are bound to our select controls.<br
      /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript">App.Collections.Customers =
      Backbone.Collection.extend({<br /> model: App.Models.Customer,<br /> url: '/customers'<br />});</pre><br
      /><pre name="code" class="javascript">App.Collections.Addresses = Backbone.Collection.extend({<br />
      model: App.Models.Address,<br /> url: '/addresses'<br />});</pre><br /><br />Again
      trivial. We tell the collection what our resource url looks like. <br /><br />Ok, now we get to the
      meat of the problem. The views. First I did was create a new view that can render a select based on a collection.
      It has a few other features I'll point out.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript">Core.Controls.Select
      = Backbone.View.extend({<br /><br /> initialize: function(){<br /> _.bindAll(this,
      'render','value','triggerDependents','selectControl','startingIndex','addModel');<br /> this.selected =
      this.options.selected;<br /> this.dependent_views = this.options.dependent_views;<br /> // if the
      collection changes, re-renders<br /> this.collection.bind("all", this.render);<br /> this.render();<br
      /> },<br /> events:{<br /> "change": "triggerDependents"<br /> },<br /> defaults:{<br
      /> collection: [], // The collection to render<br /> selected: null, // The selected model<br />
      dependent_views: []// The dependent views to notify on change<br /> },<br /> render: function(){<br
      /> this.el.html(JST.select(this));<br /> },<br /> selectControl: function() {return
      this.$("select");},<br /> value: function() { return this.selectControl().val();},<br /> // returns
      the starting index into the collection<br /> startingIndex: function(){<br /> var index = 0;<br />
      if(this.options.blank)index = index +1;<br /> return index;<br /> },<br /> addModel:
      function(model,selected){<br /> if(selected)this.selected = model;<br /> this.collection.add(model);<br
      /> return this;<br /> },<br /> triggerDependents: function(event) {<br /><br />
      if(this.selectControl().selectedIndex>=this.startingIndex())this.selected =
      this.collection.at(this.selectControl().selectedIndex-this.startingIndex());<br /> var _this = this;<br />
      _.each(this.dependent_views,function(view){<br /> view.trigger(_this.id+"."+event.type, _this);<br />
      });<br /> }<br />});<br /></pre><br /><br />Let's break this one done a little
      bit. Backbone has an initialize function that gets called after the object is created. In our initialize we do the
      following:<br /><br />First we use the underscore function that will ensure that when our function is
      called from an event somewhere, the this variable is setup as we expect it. In Ruby or other languages it is
      impossible to call an object without its self or this setup correctly. Javascript is like C. You can do objects,
      but they are not really first class citizens. Once you get used to these quirks they are quite serviceable. Second
      we pull out a couple of class attributes that we expect to be passed into the constructor. By default the
      constructor puts these into the <em>options</em> hash, because they are really core to our class we
      pull them up. This is a style thing. I left some other options in the hash, because they were not a fundamental
      data structure to our view. We then bind to our collection, so if anything changes on the collection it will all
      our render method and redraw our view. Finally we render the control.<br /><br />The next thing you
      see are two hashes: <em>events</em> and <em>defaults</em>. Events in views are jquery
      events and this hash is a shortcut for binding to them. We bind to the change event and call our function
      triggerDependents. Note: If you extend this 'class' and define an events hash it will take precedence over the
      base. The <em>defaults</em> hash is used to pre-populate the options with defaults. I've setup the
      collection and dependent_views as empty arrays (instead of null). I also setup select as null. Although null is
      not a very useful default , I think it documents what options the class will accept. <br /><br />Now
      in our render we are simply putting into the html element the results of our select template. We are using the
      _.template method from the underscore library and Jammit is managing the template loading and compilation. Let's
      take a look at the template:<br /><br /><script
      src="https://gist.github.com/1132170.js?file=select.jst"></script><br /><br />We are building
      the select control using the collection, selected and options passed in. <br /><br />So far so good.
      Nice and clean. <br /><br />I'm going to leave the rest of the select control as an exercise for the
      reader. I do want to point out the <em>triggerDependents</em> function. This will trigger the change
      event to any dependent_views passed into our constructor. It appends the id of the control so that a dependent
      view can listen to many controls and catch their events separately. We are using the event binding with
      backbone.js for this communication. This is independent from jquery events. it seems a little strange at first
      that they are not related, but the separation makes sense. If you have non-DOM events you want to trigger and
      handle, then use the model and view .bind and .trigger methods. The events hash does not route these non-dom
      events, so you have to bind to them in your initialize (or wherever is most appropriate.)<br /><br />OK
      so were are we at. We have a select control that will notify any dependent views when they are changed. I think we
      are ready to actually use them. Let's start with the select for customer addresses.<br /><br /><pre
      name="code" class="javascript">App.Views.CustomersAddressSelect = Core.Controls.Select.extend({ <br />
      initialize: function(){<br /> Core.Controls.Select.prototype.initialize.call(this);<br />
      this.bind("order_customer_id.change", this.loadAddresses);<br /> },<br /> loadAddresses:
      function(control){<br /> this.collection.reset();<br /> if(control.value()>0){<br />
      this.collection.fetch({data: {"parent_key[customer_id]": control.value()}});<br /> }<br /> }<br />});</pre><br
      /><br />Here you see we are binding to the order_customer_id.change event that will get fired by the
      customer select. In response to this event we reset our collection. (This will cause a render that will disable
      the control, while we fetch the new records.) Then we fetch the addresses passing the parent key that our
      controller expects to filter the addresses. <br /><br />Note: From a security perspective you are
      going to want some server side check to make sure the given request is allowed to view the given records. That is
      clearly beyond the scope of this post!<br /><br />OK now to hook it all up we have the following:<br
      /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript">$(function(){<br /> // our empty address
      collection<br /> var addresses = new App.Collections.Addresses([]);<br /> // Our dependent customer
      addresses select<br /> var shipping_address_select = new App.Views.CustomersAddressSelect({el:
      $('#ship_to_address_select'),<br /> id: 'order_shipping_address_id',<br /> name: 'order[
      shipping_address_id]',<br /> collection: addresses});<br /> // Our customers collection - populated
      from the server<br /> var customers = new App.Collections.Customers(<%= raw select.collect{ |ct| {:name=>ct.name,
      :id=>ct.id}}.to_json %>);<br /> // The customer select, here we pass in the customers collection and
      the shipping_address_select dependent view.<br /> new Core.Controls.Select({el: $('#customer_select'),<br
      /> id: 'order_customer_id',<br /> name: 'order[customer_id]',<br /> collection: customers,<br />
      blank: 'Select a customer',<br /> // set the shipping_address_select as dependent view<br /> // this
      will cause all events of the customer select to get<br /> // fired to the dependent controls with the
      id.event<br /> dependent_views:[shipping_address_select]});<br />});</pre><br /><br />Wow
      that looks pretty simple. We are doing a couple of things here to note: <br /><br /> This is a erb
      file that is building up the collection of customers on the server. Since we sourced this code from the server, we
      could save the round trip to fetch the customers. We could have fetched the customers from the client just as
      easily. <br /><br />We are binding to existing elements on the page by passing in <pre>el:
      $(selector)</pre>.<br /><br />We are passing in the shipping_address_select control as a
      dependent_view, this hooks up our notifications on change.<br /><br />Note: if you override the <em>events</em>
      hash in a derived class you will need to proxy any events that the base class was handling. In my case I ended up
      deriving a customer select class and wanted to listen to the change event. I lost my dependent view notifications,
      so in my change function I added a call to triggerDependents. I was not thrilled about this approach. I think
      preserving events in base classes would be a nice change for backbone.js.<br /><br />I hope you
      enjoyed this post. I loved working with Backbone.js and plan on building a full scale view library that makes all
      the crud operations easy as this.<br /><br />Cheers - Russell
